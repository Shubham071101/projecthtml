<p>Teaching-Learning, Research, Consultancy, and Innovation are our strong arms to achieve the objectives, and we strive to nourish them to keep them contemporary and effective.  The University is committed to create and maintain world class facilities, and create knowledge in the frontier areas of human understanding; keeping in mind the societal needs. We provide diverse opportunities and appropriate guidance to the young students coming into our fold and transform them into self-reliant, responsible, and mature citizens.

<br><br>With strongly belief in the saying, “Educationists should build the capacities of the spirit of inquiry, creativity, entrepreneurial and moral leadership among students and become role model”(Late former President of India, Dr. A.P.J. Abdul Kalam). I am confident that the Bombay Engineering is marching in the right direction, shaping the human resources, and contributing to the nation building.</p>
